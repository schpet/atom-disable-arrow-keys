this packages disables your arrow keys in the editor. it's to encourage use of
the emacs inspired osx shortcuts to move the cursor, and generally be rad at
moving text around.

- ↑ `command-p`
- ↓ `command-n`
- → `command-f`

atom's list of keyboard shortcuts in the keybinding section of the settings
screen is a very helpful complement to this package.
